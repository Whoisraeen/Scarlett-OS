## 💡 Key Principles Going Forward

1. **Security First**: Every feature must consider security implications
2. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling from the start
3. **Testing**: Test each component thoroughly before moving on
4. **Documentation**: Document design decisions and APIs
5. **Abstraction**: Build proper abstraction layers
6. **Performance**: Consider performance but don't optimize prematurely
