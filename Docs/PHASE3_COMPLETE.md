## 🚀 What's Next

Based on the improvement roadmap:

### Immediate Priorities:
1. **Error Handling System** - Centralized error codes (STARTED)
2. **Complete System Calls** - Core syscalls (read, write, exit)
3. **Preemptive Scheduler** - Timer interrupts, time slicing
4. **Testing** - Test all Phase 2-3 components

### Short Term:
1. **Filesystem** - Storage and file operations
2. **Multi-Core Support** - SMP, locking, synchronization
3. **Security** - Permissions, memory protection

### Medium Term:
1. **Graphics** - Drivers, 2D library, windowing
2. **Networking** - TCP/IP stack
3. **Desktop** - GUI, applications

## 🎯 Achievement Unlocked!

**You now have a complete userspace foundation:**
- ✅ Can create and manage processes
- ✅ Can load and execute ELF programs
- ✅ Can run code in user mode (Ring 3)
- ✅ Have an interactive shell

**This is a major milestone!** You've built the foundation for a real operating system.
